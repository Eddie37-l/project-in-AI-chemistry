    "### 🧐 What is RuBERT ? \n",
    "\n",
    "**RuBERT** is a machine learning model designed to **predict the yields** of ruthenium-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions on carbonyl compounds using molecular representations processed through **ChemBERTa**. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Developed as part of a cheminformatics research project, RuBERT combines chemical knowledge with deep learning to support data-driven reaction optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The model leverages SMILES-based inputs and transformer-based embeddings to learn from a wide variety of ligands and carbonyl substrates. It aims to help chemists prioritize reaction conditions, reduce experimental trial-and-error, and gain insights into catalytic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **RuBERT** integrates key concepts from computational chemistry, natural language processing, and reaction engineering into a flexible and scalable tool for predictive modeling in catalysis.\n"
